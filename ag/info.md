# Notes for Algebraic Geometry

This folder contains my notes on algebraic geometry. The main reference book is of course Hartshorne's *Alegrbaic Geometry*. However, Hartshorne's text is not very friendly to first-encounters, and it also contains some problematic definitions (links to be included here; I couldn't recall where I saw a thread listing the incorrect definitions in Hartshorne). Therefore, to understand the subject fully, I may also refer to [EGA]{https://github.com/ryankeleti/ega} and [Stacks Project]{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/}
